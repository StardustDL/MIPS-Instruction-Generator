# MIPS-Instruction-Generator

An experimental tool to generate instructions on MIPS architecture (MIPS-32).

- This is an experimental project for learning purposes.
- To try these techniques: Go.
- Created for [Experimental-MIPS-CPU](https://github.com/StardustDL/Experimental-MIPS-CPU)
- The emulator's memory is 32bit, which means each address contains a 32 bit data.

# Use

```sh
make run
```
